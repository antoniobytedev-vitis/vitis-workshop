# Task
Synthesize the code twice. First as is and then by doing a complete partition of the correct dimension of A so we can achieve II=1. Fill the following table and compare the results.
## Finished table
| Metric                        | **Without Partitioning** | **With Complete partitioning** 
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------- | 
| **Total Latency (cycles)**    |                      |                                 |                                    |
| **LUTs Used**                 |                        |                                 |                                    |
| **FFs Used**                  |                        |                                 |                                    |
