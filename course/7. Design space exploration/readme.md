# Design space exploration
This section is dedicated to the exploration and comparative analysis of different hardware architectures generated from a common algorithmic description using High-Level Synthesis (HLS). Unlike previous sections, which focus mainly on understanding individual pragmas and their isolated behaviour, the objective here is to integrate multiple optimization techniques and evaluate their combined effect on both performance and resource utilization. The focus of this section is comparing the results various pragmas can have on the same code, and make the student choose which architecture is better and why.

All exercises on this section are based on real algorithms so that students can test their acquired knowledge in a practical context.
