# TASK
Synthesize the code 4 times:

One without array partitioning.

One using cyclic partitioning with factor 4.

One using block partitioning with factor 4.

One using complete partitioning.

Compare the achievable Initiation Interval (II), total latency, and resource usage for each case. Explain how the number of memory ports available changes with each partitioning type, and why in some cases the II cannot be reduced further due to memory access limitations.
