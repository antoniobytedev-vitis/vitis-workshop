# TASK
Add the #pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1 directive to pipeline the loop. Then run C synthesis in Vitis HLS for both the original and modified versions of the code.

Compare the following synthesis results:

Total latency (in clock cycles),Initiation interval (II),Resource usage (LUTs, FFs, DSPs) and Maximum clock frequency. Use them to fill the following table.
## Finished table
| Metric                        | **Without Pipelining** | **With `#pragma HLS PIPELINE`** |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------- |
 **Total Latency (cycles)**    |                        |                                
| **LUTs Used**                 |                        |                                 |
| **FFs Used**                  |                        |                                 |
| **DSPs Used**                 |                        |                                 |
| **BRAMs Used**                |                        |                                 |
