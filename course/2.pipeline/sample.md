Pipelining is one of the most powerful features in HLS for increasing performance. This section dives into #pragma HLS PIPELINE and the concept of initiation interval (II), showing how to turn sequential loops into deeply pipelined hardware stages. We’ll also discuss how dependencies and loop structure affect pipeline efficiency.
