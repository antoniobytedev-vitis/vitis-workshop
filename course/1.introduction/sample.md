This tutorial is designed to help you develop efficient hardware accelerators using Vitis HLS, Xilinx’s high-level synthesis tool. Whether you're targeting FPGAs for embedded systems or data center acceleration, this guide walks you through key concepts such as interfacing, memory management, parallelism, and performance optimization. Each section builds your understanding of how C/C++ code is transformed into hardware, with a focus on writing designs that are not only functionally correct but also resource-efficient and high-performing.
